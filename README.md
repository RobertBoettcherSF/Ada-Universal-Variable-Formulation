# Universal Variable Formulation in Ada 2023

## Project Overview
The Universal Variable Formulation is a unified mathematical framework in astrodynamics used to solve the two-body Kepler problem across all orbital regimes—elliptic (e < 1), parabolic (e = 1), and hyperbolic (e > 1)—without branch switching, coordinate singularities, or numerical instability near parabolic boundaries. Central to this approach are Stumpff functions c_k(z) and the universal anomaly chi, which generalize Kepler's equation and time-of-flight formulations through Gauss f and g Lagrange coefficients. This project provides a pure, zero-warning Ada 2023 (ISO/IEC 8652:2023) implementation encompassing vector kinematics, Stumpff transcendental evaluation, universal orbit propagation, and the universal Lambert boundary-value problem solver.

## Features
- Unified Conic Handling: Continuous propagation of position and velocity vectors across circular, elliptic, parabolic, and hyperbolic trajectories using a single algorithm.
- Stumpff Functions (c_0 through c_5): Accurate evaluation combining stable Taylor series expansions for |z| < 0.1 and exact trigonometric/hyperbolic closed-form expressions for larger values.
- Universal Kepler Solver: High-precision Newton-Raphson iteration solving for universal anomaly chi, with domain-specific starting estimates across orbit regimes.
- Gauss f and g Invariant Propagation: Exact state propagation with full preservation of specific mechanical energy and angular momentum.
- Universal Lambert Boundary Solver: Solves the orbit determination problem (finding velocity vectors v_1 and v_2 given r_1, r_2, and Delta t) for both prograde and retrograde orbital transfers.
- Strong Typing & Safety: Domain-specific types for distance, velocity, gravitational parameters, and universal anomaly, annotated with Ada contracts (Pre, Post, Global).

## Building
- Prerequisites: GNAT supporting Ada 2022/2023 (e.g., GNAT FSF 13+, GNAT Community 2021+, or Alire gnat_native).
- Compilation:
  make
  The compiler flags -gnatwa -gnat2022 ensure clean compilation without any warnings.

## Testing
The test executable tests.adb validates 13 distinct verification criteria across four primary disciplines:
1. Functional Correctness: Exact series matching for Stumpff transcendental functions, Kepler equation convergence, and energy/angular momentum invariants.
2. Dynamic Invariants: Closed-loop orbital period verification, coordinate inversion at pi radians, and time reversibility (t -> t + Delta t -> t).
3. Boundary Value Solvers: Universal Lambert orbital transfers verified by forward numerical propagation of computed initial velocities to match target terminal coordinates.
4. Defensive Programming & Edge Cases: Proper raising of Invalid_State, Singularity_Error, and Convergence_Error on physical singularities (zero radius, collinear transfer planes, vanishing derivatives).
